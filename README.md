## About

Code Academy Parcel Service (CAPS)

- A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).

## Features and stories

- User

- As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up
- As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered
- As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit
- As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered
- As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered

- Developer

- As a developer, I want to use industry standards for managing the state of each package
- As a developer, I want to create an event driven system so that I can write code that happens in response to events, in real time
